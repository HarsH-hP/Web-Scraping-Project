# Web-Scraping-Project

A web scrapping project which scrapes the rankings of the teams, batsmans, bowlers and all-rounders in ODI format using Python, BeautifulSoap, Pandas, HTML and creates seperate excel files with the details.

This project shows how to handle the request and response and scrape the details from different web-pages by fetching link through scrapping instead of giving a default link.
